# llm.cs

This is a reference C# port of the @karpathy's [LLM training in simple, raw C/CUDA](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c)

The CPU port works. Both train_gtp2.cs and test_gpt2.cs produce numerically identical results as their C/CPU counter parts. Unfortunately both the C/CPU and the C#/CPU are not usable to train anything meaningful at this time.

## quick start
